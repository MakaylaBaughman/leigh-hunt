The poet and polemicist John Milton was perhaps the most influential English literary forebear for Hunt. Although from childhood Hunt steeped himself in the works of the canonical giants Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare, Milton was for him something of an idol (Roe 22). Of the twenty-one public figures included in Hunt’s Hair Book, Milton is the only one whose page features a sonnet Hunt penned in response to it. Hunt wrote three sonnets about this lock of Milton’s hair, and after showing it to his friend John Keats, Keats also wrote a tributary poem. While the lock might be dismissed as a mere curio, and as a potentially spurious one at that, Hunt’s sonnets in response to his encounter with Milton’s hair are remarkable for Hunt’s emphasis of Milton’s presence over his absence. While Wordsworth’s “London, 1802” uses the sonnet form to apostrophize Milton, Hunt’s sonnets treat Milton’s hair as offering the synecdochic presence of the author. Hence, while Wordsworth’s Milton is a remote and sublime figure, Hunt figures Milton as a sociable and accessible influence.
