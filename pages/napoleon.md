The French emperor and military commander Napoleon Bonaparteâ€™s prominence during the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars cemented him as a major figure in the early 19th century. His legacy as a political and cultural leader imbued the world with fascination and fear, and produced a political fervor that seized commoner, royal, and journalist alike. 
Leigh Hunt was similarly absorbed with the political ascent, and the resultant descent, of Napoleon, his career as a critic and political journalist making him a key commentator on the life of Bonaparte.
