The English Romantic poet, playwright, and essayist Percy Bysshe Shelley was Hunt’s dearest and most intimate friend. It was Shelley who pursued the acquaintance after reading Hunt’s journalism, particularly that which criticized the Prince of Wales. Hunt’s trial and conviction for seditious libel was well-publicized, in part by Hunt himself, who kept writing and editing for the Examiner from inside Surrey Gaol. From Oxford, where he was attending the university but would soon face expulsion for his essay The Necessity of Atheism, Shelley took notice of Hunt and wrote to him (Roe 138). Though Hunt did not reply, Shelley persisted, and the pair met in the spring of 1811, with Hunt’s father-in-law, Rowland Hunter, facilitating the introduction (Holden 48).

{% include feature/modal.html button="Hunt and Shelley's Early Friendship" title="Hunt and Shelley" text="Hunt and Shelley’s friendship built slowly at first, but deepened rapidly after the suicide of Shelley’s first wife, Harriet, in 1816. During this time, Shelley lodged with the Hunt family as he sought information about Harriet’s death (Holden 107). Hunt’s deep attachment to Shelley was forged during this time of intense vulnerability, and Shelley seems to have fully reciprocated Hunt’s affection. Shelley and Hunt viewed “male friendship as an exalted attachment” and found in each other an ideal and idealized partner (Roe 287). Hunt’s intimacy with Shelley apparently caused strain to his other relationships, including that with his wife Marianne and sister-in-law Bess (Roe 292). But Shelley was fond of Hunt’s children and was particularly close to Hunt’s eldest son Thornton, with whom he often played imaginative games (Holden 110). Hunt eventually named his fifth child after Shelley (Holden 132). Shelley later dedicated his play The Cenci to Hunt (Roe 319)." color="primary" %}
